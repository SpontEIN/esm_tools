To use the new version of the esm-tools, now rewritten in Python, clone this repository::
    
    git clone git@gitlab.awi.de:esm_tools/esm_tools.git
    
Then, run the ``install.sh``

    ./install.sh
    
You should now have the command line tools ``esm-master`` and ``esm-runscripts``, which replace the old version.
